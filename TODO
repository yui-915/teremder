Next:
- more shapes (line,circle, triangle, polygon, ellipse, arc, hexagon, etc ...)
- "stroke" shapes (only draw outlines)
- a function to draw shapes from their math struct instead of raw numbers (smth like macroquad 0.5 builder pattern)
- some sort of "animate" function that works with anything using lerp

Todo:
- improve sprites api (scaling, rotation, better cration and modification, filtering, etc ...)
- save/load sprites from files
- custom shapes (just triangles ?)
- extended shapes api (rotation, gradient, etc ...)
- colors with transparency
- sound library 
- text rendering (probably using sprites for font)
- actual text rendering (using actual terminal characters)
- complete the input api
- drop less input events due to sleep
- make input feel more responsive with lower fps
- an actual game loop with delta time (with the ability to scale it)
- alot of refactoring
- readme.md
- documentation
- examples
- tests
- event based input api
- no panics ? 
- ui (buttons, boxes, etc ...)
- betters types system
- a way to "move" the "camera"
- virtual resolution
- animated sprites
- loading and switching between multiple scenes
- global filters
- fps related funtions
- a way to benchmark and profile performance
- textures (basically sprites?)
- "keyboard input" (text) (maybe just the event-based api)
- a way to create child contexts (virtual windows)
- anti-aliasing
- get enumset of all keys down (to use with "match" for directional movement)
- const, no nightly features

Partially done:
- math library (vector, box, etc ...) with operator overloading and collision detection (needs more shapes)
- randmosness
- make everything f32

Done:
- more const colors

Removed: 
- web support ?!?!!?!?! (there aint no way I'm dealing with the async hell that is javascript's event loop)
- async ?! (WHY)
